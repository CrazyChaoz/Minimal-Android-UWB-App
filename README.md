# Minimal working UWB App

This is a minimal Android UWB App utilizing the currently available APIs (uwb:1.0.0-alpha04) for a very simple implementation.
This Project is written in Java, utilizes the user as out-of-band mechanism for configuration, and only supports 1:1 connections, as the library only implements these currently.
